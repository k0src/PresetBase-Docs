PresetBase is a community-driven project, and we welcome contributions from everyone. Before submitting your content, please ensure that it adheres to the following guidelines.

## Relevant Submissions

We welcome all submissions, including presets from lesser-known songs and artists. However, we prioritize submissions that are relevant to the PresetBase community. This includes:

- Presets for popular songs or artists.
- Presets that are frequently requested by the community.
- Presets that showcase unique or innovative techniques.
- Presets that are well-documented and easy to understand.

Songs should be at least somewhat well-known. Underground music is welcome, but it should be something that the community would find interesting or useful. Don't submit presets for songs that are completely unknown or irrelevant to the community.

## Accuracy

All submissions should meet our accuracy standards:

- The preset should be the exact preset used in the song. No presets that "sound like" the instrument used in the song.
- Do not attempt to "recreate" the sound if it is not the exact preset used in the song.
- If you are not sure about the accuracy of your preset, please do not submit it.

## Sources

Often times, the exact preset used in a song is obvious from the source material. For example, [Black Beatles](https://presetbase.app/song/15) by Rae Sremmurd is a well-known song that uses a specific sequence from Dune 3. The sequence is unaltered, and the preset is the exact preset used in the song. In other cases, the preset may not be so obvious. In these cases, you should ensure that the preset is the exact preset used in the song. This can be done in the following ways:

- **Official Breakdowns/Project Files**: If the artist has released an official breakdown (such as a Genius interview) or project file, this can be used to confirm the preset. This is the most reliable source for the exact preset used in a song.
- **Interviews/Comments**: If the artist has commented on the preset in an interview or on social media, this can be used to confirm the preset. This is a less reliable source, but can still be useful.
- **Community Consensus**: If the community has reached a consensus on the preset, this can be used to confirm the preset. This is the least reliable source, but can still be useful.
- **Sonic Analysis**: If the preset is not confirmed by any of the above sources, the correct preset can be determined by analyzing the sound using a graphical EQ, or by other means. See [Aiden Kenway's Type Shit remake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUMHOr781d0) for an example of this technique. This is the least reliable source, but can still be useful. You should use your best judgement when determining the preset.
