# Song Guidelines

There are 5 pieces of information that must be provided when submitting a new song:

<Steps>
### Song Title

Provide the entire full name of the song. Do not include artists, features, producers, etc. Do not include verisons, unless the preset is specific to that verison.

- For example "VIP Mix" or "2025 Remaster" should not be included in the title.

The capitalization of the title should match the official release.

- For example, "we not like you" should be capitalized as such, not "We Not Like You" or "We not like You".

### Song Genre

Provide the genre of the song. The genre should match the genre of the song as it is commonly known. List only one genre, in Title Case.

- For example, "Hip Hop", "Rock", "Pop", etc.

### Release Year

Provide the year the song was released. This should be the year of the original release, not a remaster or re-release, unless the preset is specific to that version.
If the song was released on multiple dates, such as on an album or compilation, use the earliest date.

### Song URL

Provide a link to the song on a Youtube. This should be a link to the official release of the song, not a fan upload or remix. Use the "audio" or "lyric video" version if available, not a music video.

### Cover Image

Provide a link to the cover image of the song. This should be a link to the official cover image of the song, not a fan upload or remix. The image should be at least 1000x1000 pixels.

> [!TIP]
>
> Don't use Google Images to find cover images. Instead, use official sources such as the artist's website, music streaming services, or music databases like Discogs or MusicBrainz.
> **Most song and album covers can be found on [the Cover Search Engine](https://covers.musichoarders.xyz/).**
